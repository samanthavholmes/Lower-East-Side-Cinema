## Summary
 Mock client project with a dealine of two days, simulating a web app that allows users and judges to rate and review movies in different genres. Each genre has a multitude of movies simulated by the faker gem. All of these movies are able to be rated 0-5, reviewed, and commented on. The reviews are also commentable. In order to be able to review, comment, or rate a movie, one must resgiter or login. Security was achieved using the bcrypt gem. If a user is not registered or logged in, they are still able to use basic functionality to browse the web app, look at the latest movies, as well as sort them by highest rated and most recent.
